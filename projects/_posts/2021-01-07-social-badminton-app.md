### Context
The official badminton website for our area was old, and there was no website that contained all the available badminton session in one easy-to-find location. Because of this, I wanted to create a website that showed all the weekly sessions available at the local sports clubs.

### Description
View all local badminton clubs in Brisbane and see all the available sessions playing near you!

### Project Goals
- Create a website that shows a listing of all local badminton clubs
- Shows weekly & monthly schedule of available badminton sessions

### My role
As this was a solo project, I was responsible for the design and back-end implementation of the website.

### Outcome
This experience was extremely meaningful as it was specifically made for a colleague. It was also my first experience designing & implementing a website for a real community, which emphasised the importance of target audience research.

### Workflow
  1. Research with local community - asked about most important features and their main target audience
  2. Work through user stories and created a detailed prototype using Figma
  3. Creating database schema and relations for postgreSQL
  4. Ask for feedback from community regarding front-end design and user experience
  5. Implement back-end features in rails
  6. Implement design using figma prototype
