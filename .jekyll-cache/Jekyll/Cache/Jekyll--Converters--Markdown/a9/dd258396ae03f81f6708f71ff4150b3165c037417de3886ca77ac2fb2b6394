I"U<p>! This project is still in progress</p>
<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<p>The official badminton website for our area was old, and there was no website that contained all the available badminton session in one easy-to-find location. Because of this, I wanted to create a website that showed all the weekly sessions available at the local sports clubs.</p>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>View all local badminton clubs in Brisbane and see all the available sessions playing near you!</p>

<h3 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create a website that shows a listing of all local badminton clubs</li>
  <li>Shows weekly &amp; monthly schedule of available badminton sessions</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="my-role">My role</h3>
<p>As this was a solo project, I was responsible for the design and back-end implementation of the website.</p>

<h3 id="outcome">Outcome</h3>
<p>This experience was extremely meaningful as it was specifically made for a colleague. It was also my first experience designing &amp; implementing a website for a real community, which emphasised the importance of target audience research.</p>
