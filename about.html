    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>I studied Pharmacy and also graduated from a Full-Stack bootcamp at the end of 2020.
      I became interested in pursuing tech after experiencing the constant frustration of patients not being able to
      use apps to their full potential. I wanted to become involved in creating and building elegant apps that seamlessly integrate into everyday life.</p>
    <p>Other factors that sparked my interest were the strong focus on collaboration and the supportive tech communities around me.
      Working in retail and health-care has taught me the importance of putting users first, and the power of embracing collaboration between professionals with different specialisations and skillsets.</p>
    <h3>Technology</h3>
    <p>I've been building primarily using Ruby on Rails & postgreSQL, but am currently teaching myself javascript so I can dive into more JS frameworks</p>
