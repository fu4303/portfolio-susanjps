### Context
This project was completed as a final project of my bootcamp. The original pitch idea was delivered by Rob, who wanted to create a curation website that is more meaningful than the sharing that is seen in traditional social media sites.

### Project Goal
- To create a space to share meaningful & personal digital gifts to close friends
- To create something playful, with an amazing user experience

### My Experience
As this project was to be completed in under 2 weeks, we brainstormed and worked through creating user stories, db schema and prototyping in figma together. From there, we were all assigned different sections of the website. Implementing and styling the photo-stories was my responsibility.

### Outcome
