### Context
A personal project to experiment with building and deploying static websites

### Description
Come along with me in my journey of transitioning from health care to software engineering. The main themes of my posts will be around tech career, short explanations of development concepts and there will be book reviews from time to time.

### Project Goal
- To create a place where I could record everything I've learnt while experimenting and building.
- To improve my technical writing and communication skills

### Outcome
Of course, this project is a continual project and I have a few ideas for features I would like to play around with. For now, I'll keep posting about all the challenges that I face in the hopes that someone reading it will learn something new!

### What I learnt
This was my first time working with Jekyll. I tried it once, gave up and went back and tried it again. The second time was a blast!! From this project I learnt that when you stick with something long enough, it tends to finally make sense.
