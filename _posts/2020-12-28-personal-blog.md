### Context
A personal project to experiment with building and deploying static websites

### Project Goal
- To create a place where I could record everything I've learnt while experimenting and building.
- To improve my technical writing and communication skills

### My Experience
This was my first time working with Jekyll. I tried it once, gave up and went back and tried it again.

From this project I learnt that when you stick with something long enough, it tends to finally make sense.

### Outcome
Of course, this project is a continual project and I have a few ideas for features I would like to play around with. For now, I'll keep posting about all the challenges that I face in the hopes that someone reading it will learn something new!
