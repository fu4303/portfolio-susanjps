### Description
Basic rails MVC app for creating and saving cocktail ingredients.

### My role
Full-stack Developer. This project was done as a pair-programming exercise. We both shared the workload from back-end to front-end styling.

### Project Goals
- Design & implement an application to create, update, save and delete cocktail ingredients.

### Technology
Rails MVC, PostgreSQL, SaSS, bootstrap, heroku, AWS (Cloudinary) & [The Cocktail DB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/)

### Outcome
We were able to implement all the basic features originally planned for the app. As our working styles were complimentary, working as a pair created a productive and supportive environment.

### Workflow
  1. Creating database schema and relations for postgreSQL
  2. Work together when creating database and basic crud actions, then work separately on specific, more detailed actions
  3. Design application and implement in front-end
