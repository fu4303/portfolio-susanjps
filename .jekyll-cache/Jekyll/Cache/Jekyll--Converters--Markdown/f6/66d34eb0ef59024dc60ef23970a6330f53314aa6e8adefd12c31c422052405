<p>This project was completed as a final project of my bootcamp. The original pitch idea was delivered by Rob, who wanted to create a curation website that is more meaningful than the sharing that is seen in traditional social media sites.</p>

<h3 id="project-goal">Project Goal</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To create a space to share meaningful &amp; personal digital gifts to close friends</li>
  <li>To create something playful, with an amazing user experience</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="my-experience">My Experience</h3>
<p>As this project was to be completed in under 2 weeks, we brainstormed and worked through creating user stories, db schema and prototyping in figma together. From there, we were all assigned different sections of the website. Implementing and styling the photo-stories was my responsibility.</p>

<h3 id="outcome">Outcome</h3>
<p>Of course, this project is a continual project and I have a few ideas for features I would like to play around with. For now, Iâ€™ll keep posting about all the challenges that I face in the hopes that someone reading it will learn something new!</p>
