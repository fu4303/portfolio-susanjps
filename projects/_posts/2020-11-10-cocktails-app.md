### Context
This project was our first rails CRUD app that we were creating from beginning to end.

### Project Goals
- Design & implement an application to create, update, save and delete cocktail ingredients.

### Technology
Rails MVC, PostgreSQL, SaSS, bootstrap, heroku , AWS (Cloudinary) & [The Cocktail DB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/)

### My role
This project was done as a pair-programming exercise, and would alternate between doing work alone and working together when we encountered something more difficult.

### Outcome
We were able to implement all the basic features originally planned for the app. As our working styles were complimentary, working as a pair created a productive and supportive environment.

### Workflow
  1. Creating database schema and relations for postgreSQL
  2. Work together when creating database and basic crud actions, then work separately on specific, more detailed actions
  3. Design application and implement in front-end
