      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I'm currently transitioning from Pharmacy into tech, and looking for an entry-level Software Developer position.
        I became interested in pursuing tech after experiencing the constant frustration of patients not being able to
        use apps to their full potential. I wanted to become involved in creating intuitive and elegant apps that seamlessly integrate into everyday life.</p>
      <p>Working in retail and health-care has taught me the importance of putting users first, and the power of embracing collaboration between professionals with different specialisations and skillsets.
         I love that the tech community has such a strong focus on collaboration and building supportive communities.</p>
      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>I've been building primarily using Ruby on Rails & postgreSQL, but am currently teaching myself javascript so I can dive into more JS frameworks</p>
