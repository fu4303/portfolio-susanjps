    <h2>Hi! Iâ€™m Susan, a full-stack web developer. </h2>
    <p>I'm a Pharmacy school and Full-Stack Bootcamp graduate.
       I became interested in pursuing tech after experiencing the constant frustration of patients not being able to
       use apps to their full potential due to small considerations being missed. I wanted to become involved in creating beautifully elegant,quality apps that integrate seamlessly into everyday life.</p>
    <p>Coming from health and working in a customer-focused environment has taught me the importance of putting users first, and the power of embracing collaboration between professionals with different specialisations and skillsets.</p>
