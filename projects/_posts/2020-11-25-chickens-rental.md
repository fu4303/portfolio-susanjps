### Context
To create an app with an infrastructure similar to AirBnB but lists something fun!

### Description
View, list and book the company of only the very best chickens near you! Leave reviews to help future users.

### Project Goals
- Have a system where users can create, edit and delete listings for an item
- Implement a feature where users can create bookings on other users' items

### My role
This was our first group project to create a complicated app. We worked together in the first phases of the project (brainstorming, user stories, creating database) and assigned roles for back-end feature implementation. I was responsible for creating bookings.

### Workflow
  1. Work together when creating database and basic CRUD actions
  2. Assigning each app feature a priority label - important/basic features, great features to have and low priority, nice-to-have features.
  3. Assigning specific roles for each group member

### What I learnt
As the first complex app that we created, this project was at times frustrating and confusing. However, it taught me the value of collaborative working environments and the importance of keeping a balance between working independently and collaboratively.
