<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<p>A personal project to experiment with building and deploying static websites</p>

<h3 id="project-goal">Project Goal</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To create a place where I could record everything I’ve learnt while experimenting and building.</li>
  <li>To improve my technical writing and communication skills</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="my-experience">My Experience</h3>
<p>This was my first time working with Jekyll. I tried it once, gave up and went back and tried it again.</p>

<p>From this project I learnt that when you stick with something long enough, it tends to finally make sense.</p>

<h3 id="outcome">Outcome</h3>
<p>Of course, this project is a continual project and I have a few ideas for features I would like to play around with. For now, I’ll keep posting about all the challenges that I face in the hopes that someone reading it will learn something new!</p>
