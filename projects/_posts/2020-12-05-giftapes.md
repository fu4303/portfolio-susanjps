### Description
Put the meaning back into sharing - curate fun "microsites" and share with friends. Choose between creating a mixtape, photo-story, a personal quiz or a curated list of interesting links and articles.

### My Role
Full-stack Developer. As a team, we brainstormed and worked through creating user stories, db schema and prototyping in figma together. From there, we were all assigned different sections of the website. Implementing and styling the photo-stories was my responsibility.

### Technology
Rails MVC, PostgreSQL, bootstrap, SaSS, JavaScript, GitHub & git version control, heroku, AWS (Cloudinary), integration with [GIPHY API](https:1//developers.giphy.com/) & [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3).

### Project Goals
- To create a space to share meaningful & personal digital gifts to close friends
- To create something playful, with an amazing fun experience
- To ensure that this gift would only be viewable to the person receiving, via a unique link

### Work flow
1. Brainstorming, creating user stories, database, routes and basic controllers
2. Assigning each app feature a priority label - important, medium and low priority features
3. Assigning the design & implementation of a specific gift to each group member
4. Each morning we did a stand-up to discuss what was achieved yesterday, today's goals and to create an opportunity to discuss any difficult conversations so that we can support our team mates.
