I"”<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<p>To create an app with an infrastructure similar to AirBnB but lists something fun!</p>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>View, list and book the company of only the very best chickens near you! Leave reviews to help future users.</p>

<h3 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Have a system where users can create, edit and delete listings for an item</li>
  <li>Implement a feature where users can create bookings on other usersâ€™ items</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="my-role">My role</h3>
<p>This was our first group project to create a complicated app. We worked together in the first phases of the project (brainstorming, user stories, creating database) and assigned roles for back-end feature implementation. I was responsible for creating bookings.</p>

<h3 id="workflow">Workflow</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Work together when creating database and basic CRUD actions</li>
  <li>Assigning each app feature a priority label - important/basic features, great features to have and low priority, nice-to-have features.</li>
  <li>Assigning specific roles for each group member</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-i-learnt">What I learnt</h3>
<p>As the first complex app that we created, this project was at times frustrating and confusing. However, it taught me the value of collaborative working environments and the importance of keeping a balance between working independently and collaboratively.</p>
