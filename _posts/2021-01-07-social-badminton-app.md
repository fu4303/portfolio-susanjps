who, what, where, when, why
### Context
The official badminton website for our area was old, and there was no website that contained all the badminton clubs in one easy-to-find location. Because of this, I wanted to create a website that showed all the weekly sessions available at the local sports clubs.

### Project Goal
To create a simple, easy-to-use website that could be used by the badminton community.

### My Experience


### Outcome
This experience was extremely meaningful as it was specifically made for a colleague. Thinking of the user stories and user flow was extremely important.
